## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). If chapter ID is provided, use it; otherwise, use the current chapter from config.json.

## Interactive Interview Process

This command writes a chapter based on the planning document, using the current active writer profile. It strictly adheres to the novel constitution and performs consistency checks.

### Process Overview

1. **Preparation** (Automatic):
   - Read chapter plan from `.novelkit/chapters/[chapter-id]/plan.md` (meta-space)
   - Read current Writer profile from `config.json` → `current_writer.profile_path`
   - Read novel constitution from `.novelkit/memory/constitution.md`
   - Read related character profiles
   - Read related location information
   - Read related plot information (main/side plots)
   - Check constitution compliance

2. **Interactive Configuration**: Ask user about word count and writing preferences
3. **Writing Process**: Generate chapter content based on plan and writer style
4. **Constitution Check**: Verify content complies with constitution
5. **Consistency Check**: Verify consistency with previous chapters
6. **Save Chapter**: Write to `./chapters/chapter-001.md` (user space, project root)
7. **Update State Machine**: Update config.json

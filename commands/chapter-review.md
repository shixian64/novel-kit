## Comprehensive Review Process

This command performs a comprehensive review of a chapter, checking for conflicts, consistency issues, and constitution compliance. It reads all relevant context and generates a detailed review report.

2. **Chapter Analysis**: Analyze chapter content thoroughly
3. **Conflict Detection**: Check for conflicts with existing content
4. **Consistency Check**: Verify consistency across all dimensions
5. **Constitution Compliance**: Verify compliance with novel constitution
6. **Generate Review Report**: Create comprehensive review report with findings

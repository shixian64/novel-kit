## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). Support both character ID (character-xxx) and name matching.

## Interactive Update Process

This command uses an **interactive Q&A interview** approach to update an existing character profile. The process is **dynamic and adaptive**, focusing only on areas that need changes. It ensures changes are consistent with the current story state and constitution.

### Process Overview

1. **Identify Character**: Parse character ID/name from `$ARGUMENTS` or prompt user
2. **Load Character Profile**: Read existing character file
3. **Load Context**: Read constitution, recent chapters, related plots
4. **Display Current State**: Show key characteristics of current character
5. **Interactive Update Interview**: Ask targeted questions about what to change
6. **Dynamic Question Flow**: Questions adapt based on what user wants to modify
7. **Constitution Compliance Check**: Validate changes against constraints
8. **Apply Changes**: Update specific sections of character file
9. **Final Confirmation**: Review changes before saving
10. **State Machine Update**: Update config.json with update event

## Interview Structure

### Phase 1: Character Identification & Context Loading

#### Step 1: Identify Character

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided**:
- Try to match as character ID (format: `character-xxx`)
- If not found, try name matching (fuzzy search)
- Support partial matches

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty**:
- Prompt user: "Which character would you like to update?"
- Suggest: "Enter character ID (character-xxx) or name"
- Optionally list recent characters from config.json

#### Step 2: Run Update Script

Execute the character manager script:

```bash
./scripts/bash/character-manager.sh update "$ARGUMENTS"
```

The script should:
- Locate character file in `./world/characters/[character-id]/character.md` (user space, project root)
- Return JSON with:
  - Character ID
  - Character name
  - File path
  - Last modified date
  - Status

#### Step 3: Read Character Profile

Read the full character profile:
- File location: `./world/characters/[character-id]/character.md`
- Parse all sections according to character template
- Extract current values for all fields

#### Step 4: Load Context Information

**Read Novel Constitution** (ALWAYS REQUIRED):
- Read `.novelkit/memory/constitution.md`
- Extract: character constraints, ability limits, worldview rules
- **Purpose**: Check if changes violate constraints

**Read Recent Chapters** (if available):
- Read latest completed chapters from `config.json`
- Check for character mentions and development
- Extract: character's recent actions, growth, changes
- **Purpose**: Understand why update is needed

**Read Related Plots** (if character is plot-involved):
- Read active main plots: `./plots/main/[plot-id]/plot.md`
- Read active side plots: `./plots/side/[plot-id]/plot.md`
- Extract: character's role, plot requirements, story direction
- **Purpose**: Ensure updates align with plot needs

**Read Relationship Network** (if relationships changing):
- Read `./world/relationships/network.md`
- Extract: current relationships, relationship history
- **Purpose**: Ensure relationship changes are consistent

**Read Faction Information** (if faction-related):
- Read `./world/factions/[faction-id]/faction.md`
- Extract: faction status, member changes
- **Purpose**: Ensure faction updates are consistent

#### Step 5: Display Current Character State

Show key information about current character:

```markdown

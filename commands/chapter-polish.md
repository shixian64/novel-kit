## Interactive Interview Process

This command polishes and refines a completed chapter through an interactive Q&A process. It supports both local modifications and overall optimization.

### Process Overview

1. **Read Chapter** (Automatic):
   - Read chapter content from `./chapters/chapter-001.md` (user space, project root, same level as `.novelkit/`)
   - Analyze chapter structure, word count, style, etc.
   - Load writer profile for style consistency check
   - Load constitution for compliance check

2. **Interactive Configuration**: Ask user about polishing direction and scope
3. **Polishing Process**: Apply improvements based on user preferences
4. **Show Comparison**: Display before/after comparison
5. **User Approval**: Allow user to approve or request further changes
6. **Save Polished Version**: Update chapter file and record history

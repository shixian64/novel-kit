## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). Support both faction ID (faction-xxx) and name matching.

## Process Overview

This command lists the characters associated with a faction and allows for adding/removing members through an interactive process.

### Process Steps

1. **Identify Faction**: Parse ID/name from `$ARGUMENTS` or prompt user
2. **Load Faction Profile**: Read existing faction file
3. **View Members**: Display current members with their roles
4. **Interactive Management**: Offer options to add/remove/promote members
5. **Apply Changes**: Update character and faction profiles
6. **State Machine Update**: Update config.json

## View Members

### Step 1: Retrieve Member List

**Search for members**:
- Find all character files where `Affiliation` or `Faction` matches the target faction
- Read character profiles: `./world/characters/[character-id]/character.md`
- Extract: character name, ID, role within faction

### Step 2: Display Member List

Format and display:
- **Member Name** (with link to character profile)
- **Role in Faction** (Leader, Member, Traitor, etc.)
- **Join Date** (if available)
- **Status** (Active, Inactive, Expelled, etc.)

## Interactive Member Management

**The management is fully dynamic - you decide the questions, order, and depth based on context.**

### Interview Principles

1. **Question Format** (MANDATORY):
   - Each question must provide **at least 6 options** (A-F) plus Custom
   - Options must be **mutually exclusive and non-repetitive**
   - Clearly state: "You can also enter your own custom input if none of the options fit"

2. **Dynamic Flow**:
   - Each round: AI decides whether to continue based on confirmed information
   - Questions adapt based on previous answers
   - Follow-up questions only when needed

3. **Information Confirmation**:
   - All changes must be marked as **"confirmed"** or **"unconfirmed"**
   - For unconfirmed changes, AI must continue asking or provide more options

4. **Completeness Threshold**:
   - Before final save, verify all changes are confirmed
   - If information is insufficient, actively point out missing items
   - Do NOT proceed to save until all changes are confirmed
